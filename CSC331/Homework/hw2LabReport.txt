For this program, the goal is to read in lines from a file and
determine whether the string on each line is a palindrome or not,
and then output the results to the screen. 

I had previously created a program to see whether given strings
were palindromes in my Data Structures class. For that one, I used
stacks and recursion, as the homework specifications required. I
thought about reimplementing that method again, but after a bit
of working on that I realized it would be too complicated for
this assignment.

Although I attempted to use C-style strings at first, I ended up
using C++ string objects. The member functions of the string class
were far too useful to not take advantage of.
