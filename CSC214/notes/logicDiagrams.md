##Logic Dates

Third representation of a combinational circuit is to show the interaction
of the logic gates. Each operation is represented by a gate. 3 basic types
of gate: AND, OR, and Inverter (NOT). AND and OR gates take two inputs and
produces one output. The inverter takes a single input and produces one
output (unary).

Everything in Boolean algebra can be expressed in the 3 basic gates.
However, there are three other gates make things cleaner and easier.
NAND, NOR, and XOR.

NAND is the complement of AND, and NOR is the complement of OR.

a XOR b is equivalent to a * b' + a' * b

Precedence: Parentheses > Complement > AND > XOR > OR

##Set Theory Representation

Boolean algebra expressions can also be represented in terms of set
theory. We can show the area that is the result of the expression in
Venn Diagrams. OR is Union, AND is Intersection, Inverter is set
complement.
